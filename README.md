## AIM:
To detect hidden data using steganography detection tools like StegExpose and analyze file signatures for authenticity and manipulation.

## DESIGN STEPS:
### Step 1:
Install StegExpose or use the JAR version to detect steganography in image files.

### Step 2:
Run StegExpose on a directory of suspected image files using the command:

### Step 3:
Analyze file signatures using tools like file, binwalk, or xxd to check for inconsistencies or embedded content.

## PROCEDURE:
StegExpose and File Signature Analysis Commands

# Step 1: Download Image and Create Secret Message File
• Download a .jpeg image  from a trusted website or use own image.

• Create a text file named secret with a confidential message:

# Step 3: Embed the Secret Message into the Image
• Use the following command to embed secret into praveen.jpeg:

# Step 4: Delete the Original Secret File
• After embedding, delete the plaintext file:

## OUTPUT:
List of Images with Steganography Detection Scores and File Signature Details

# Step 1: Extract the Embedded Secret from the Image

• To retrieve the hidden file:
• Enter the same passphrase used during embedding.

# Step 2: Verify the Extracted Message
• Display the extracted file content to verify:

• Ensure the message matches the original secret content.

• Another command to see the same secret message is

# Step 3: Retrieve Information About the Embedded Data
• To gather details about embedded content in the image:

• This will display file type, size, and whether data is embedded.
## RESULT:
Hidden data was successfully detected and file signatures were analyzed for irregularities.
